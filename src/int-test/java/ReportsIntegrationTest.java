	 * Should do full integration test here.
	 * 
	 * Fire up local dev server
	 * Load data
	 * 
	 * Send HTTP requests to the endpoints
	 * Check data response
	 * 
	 * Shut down local dev server
	 * 
	 * I can see thundr-http-ning and appengine-testing is included probably for this reason. I have no more time to do
	 * this.
	 * 
	 * An other problem I have with this is that there is no way to set up the data - the menu and order jsons are
	 * bundled with the app. In order to be able to test this properly I'd have to create menu and order editing
	 * endpoints. Just for testing.
	 * 
	 * If the app server is run in embedded mode then it would be fine as test resources would be picked up - same way
	 * as in the Service test I've written. I have no idea if this is the case.
	 * 
	 * I'd essentially have very similar test cases here as I do in the service test.
